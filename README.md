# ISSP-income in Stata code

I know how many times you were on the verge of giving up and thought the ISSP dataset was way too unorganized. I believe that it might have given you as much headache as it did to me. I am, however, going to make YOUR life easier by sharing my code on personal and household income harmonizing for the ISSP Family and Changing Gender Roles 2002 and 2012.

I hope you give me a shout-out in your acknowledgements section :) Enjoy

What you do to the data on your next step- you need to decide yourself. It is in USD using the exchange rate for the year 2002 or 2012. 

I also add a code to break down the data into quantiles for each country and year hear as well.

# ISSP-income in Stata code

I know how many times you were on the verge of giving up and thought the ISSP dataset was way too unorganized. I believe that it might have given you as much headache as it did to me. I am, however, going to make YOUR life easier by sharing my code on personal and household income harmonizing for the ISSP Family and Changing Gender Roles 2002 and 2012.

I hope you give me a shout-out in your acknowledgements section :) Enjoy
